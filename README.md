# Front-end Developer 🙋🏼‍♂️
I'm a front-end developer with a curious mind, leading me down a rabbit hole of playing around and experimenting with all the latest JavaScript frameworks.

I work at Bump Digital, an Umbraco Gold Partner agency. My tech stack includes HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript (ES6+), C#/.NET, and Umbraco CMS. I also work with JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.js and Astro.

Occasionally, I speak at conferences and meetups. I love to get on stage and share my enthusiasm for modern web development to like-minded individuals.
